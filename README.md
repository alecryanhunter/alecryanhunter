Hey, I'm Alec!

I'm a web developer-in-training, looking to learn a lot more about coding and design.

Some of my interests include cooking, sewing, gaming of both the digital and tabletop varieties, and coding, of course!

I've got two cats, O'Malley and Tuna, and am always willing to talk about them at length and share photos.

Please peruse my profile for some examples of my work.
